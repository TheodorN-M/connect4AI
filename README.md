# Connect Four

### How to play

The game is played between yellow and red pieces. Red to begin.

Player one places their first piece on the board. The piece will, as in the original physical version of the game, fall down to the bottom open spot. Now, player two to place. A winner is decided when one of the players has four pieces in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

## AI competitor
The game has a built-in AI-player. To activate, GameState must be set to `GameState.AI_ACTIVE`. For two-player: `GameState.TWO_P_ACTIVE`. Watch out! It is easy to oversee opportunities!
